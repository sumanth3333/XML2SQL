First to run the project we need to make sure that we have installed Python, Node JS and MySQL on our system

Make sure all the required libraries are downloaded from the node JS

And check whether the MySQL database is set up

Once we have everything set up, you can download the project from the Git hub repository

Run final.py - this will create all the tables in the database and populate the data according to the XML that we have.
Then run NSF.JS - so that you will be able to access the actual website on local host and you can test it
